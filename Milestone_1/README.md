# 🎓 Study Track – AI-Based Student Study Habit Recommender

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on student study activity and performance data to uncover learning patterns and behaviors.  
The analysis helps in building insights for an **AI-based study recommendation system** that aims to improve learning efficiency and academic outcomes.

### Objectives

* Understand **student study habits**, **time management**, and **learning trends**
* Identify factors influencing **performance and productivity**
* Perform **data cleaning**, **feature creation**, and **visualizations** for deeper insights
* Support **data-driven recommendations** for personalized study plans

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.x**
* **Pandas** – Data cleaning & manipulation
* **Matplotlib** – Visualizations
* **Seaborn** – Statistical plots & correlations
* **Google Colab** – Interactive notebook environment

## 🧼 Data Cleaning Steps

1. **Loaded the CSV files** into Pandas DataFrames
2. **Handled missing values** and removed duplicates
3. **Converted date/time columns** to proper datetime formats
4. **Created new features** such as total study hours, average session duration, etc.
5. **Merged datasets** for combined analysis on habits and outcomes
6. **Filtered irrelevant or inconsistent entries** for better accuracy

---

## 📊 Key Insights (Example Findings)

* Peak study times and session durations per student
* Correlation between total study hours and academic performance
* Identification of highly active vs. low-engagement students
* Country or department-based study pattern differences
